# Kickstarter-Analysis
Performing analysis on Kickstarter data to uncover trends
## Overview of Project
The purpose of this project was to determine which campaigns were successful, failed, or canceled in comparison to their launch date and funding goals. Various types of analyses were conducted to uncover those hidden trends within the Kickstarter data set. 
## Analysis and Challenges
To begin the analysis, the data needed to be filtered and sorted using pivot tables. Louise wanted to know if theater campaigns' outcomes were successful, failed, or canceled due to the crowdfunding start date. Lousia also wanted to know what percent of total projects were successful, failed, or canceled compared to the donation goal. Overall, the challenge was an excellent refresher for navigating throughout Excel. The only challenges that arose were figuring out the error codes when VLOOKUPS or COUNTIFS were being used. The videos provided within the module were helpful, and eventually, the error codes for the function were fixed.

## Results
There are two conclusions for Outcomes Based on Launch Date. 1. The theater campaigns were most successful during the summer months of May and June. Out of 319 theater campaigns during those two months, a total of 211 campaigns exceeded their crowdfunding goals. 2. During the winter season, there was an increase in failed campaign fundraisers and decreased successful campaigns. This inverse relationship could be the cause of the holiday season. As the fiscal year comes to an end, fewer people are donating and waiting for the new year to begin. The analysis can conclude that the Outcomes Base on Goals was more successful with donations ranging from >$1,000 to $10,000. To further understand why this range was a success, if possible, look at the genres of plays people were donating to. This is one limitation of the data set. Suppose there was a column for the theater genre. In that case, Louise could understand if her play Fever falls into the category of highest donations based on genre. With the information of genres, a pie chart could help visualize which genres had the highest average donation, which had the lowest donation, and what genre had the highest pledge.
